			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p> As a graphic designer, I have had a diverse range of experiences.From <br>
				working with small businesses to collaborating with large corporations,
				 each project has taught me something new. One of the most memorable <br>
				 experiences I had was working on a branding project for a local restaurant.
				 The owner had a clear vision in mind, and it was my job to bring it to life<br>
				 through the design. It was challenging but also rewarding to see the brand 
				 come together in the end. Another experience that stands out was working on a <br>
				  packaging design for a new product launch. It was exciting to be part of the
				  process from start to finish, from developing concepts to finalizing the design.<br>
				  come together in the end. Another experience that stands out was working.
